## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security related bug in Kermoo, we kindly ask you for responsible disclosure and for giving us appropriate time to react, analyze and develop a fix to mitigate the found security vulnerability.

We will publish security advisories using the [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/evryn/kermoo/security/advisories/new) feature to keep our community well-informed, and will credit you for your findings (unless you prefer to stay anonymous, of course).

There are two ways to report a vulnerability to the Kermoo team:
- By opening a draft GitHub security advisory: https://github.com/evryn/kermoo/security/advisories/new
- By e-mail to the following address: nasiri.amirreza.96@gmail.com
